# personalPortfolio
This repository is where I begin my journey into web development, starting with HTML and CSS, and later exploring JavaScript. My goal is to create a fully functional portfolio that reflects my skills, growth, and passion for coding. I will firstly learn the basics of HTML and CSS, when I am fully prepared for the skills I gathered. I will then create my own portfolio.
